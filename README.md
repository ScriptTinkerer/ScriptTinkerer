- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScriptTinkerer! Nice to meet you.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, scripting, and tinkering with different technologies to solve problems and create cool projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning techniques to enhance my programming skills and broaden my understanding of artificial intelligence.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects.
- 📸 Fun quote: "Life is like a camera. Focus on what's important, capture the good times, develop from the negatives, and if things don't work out, take another shot."
